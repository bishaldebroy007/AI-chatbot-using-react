# AI Chatbot (Gemini-like)

I have attempted to apply what I've learned about the internet. While my approach may not be as efficient as it could be, that was never my primary goal. I wanted to step out of my comfort zone with React JS, take action, and tackle the challenges I faced using online resources for assistance (I have used React JS and Tailwind CSS in the project).

## Demo

## Features:
Ask the AI bot anything, and it will answer like any other chatbot.

## Limitations:
Some of the features, like pressing the "Enter" key to send the response, adding images to chat, or adding audio in the chat to connect with the AI bot, have not been added yet. At the same time some other features might not work as it should right away. I will work on them in the near future maybe.
